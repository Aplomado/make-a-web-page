                <b>How the Internet Works</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                The Internet is the interconnection of millions of computers. This is one giant computer <em>network</em>. Some are consuming content using <b>Web Browsers</b> or <b>Email Clients</b>. Some computers are holding those files, and <em>serving</em> them out when they are needed. These are appropriately called <b>Servers</b>.
                <br>
                When a web browser goes to a url, it is requesting the file(s) for a web site to be sent via <b>HTTP</b> from a server. HTTP is the communication protocol the Internet works on. The server finds the needed file(s), then send them back so the web browser can interpret them so they make sense to us lowly humans.

                <b>HTML</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. HTML pages form the vast majority of all content on the Internet.

                <b>Tags and Elements</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                The parts of an HTML pages, other than the text, is called <b>Elements</b>. This is the combination of <b>Tags</b>, and other things like values and URL's. <b>Tags</b> are used to tell the web browser the type of <b>Element</b> that is being seen.

                <b>Inline and Block Elements</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Elements in HTML are either <b>Inline</b> or <b>Block</b>. <b>Inline</b> elements are used inside of the text itself. <b>Block</b> elements form a <em>box</em> or <em>block</em> around the content inside of them.

                <b>HTML and CSS</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                HTML is really the structure of a webpage. It forms the <em>walls</em> and <em>floor</em> of the website if it were a house. Any thing constructed has to have a basic structure. 
                <br>
                CSS applies the styling to the webpage. It can control font type, font size, even color. CSS is the artistic <em>decor</em> of the HTML <em>house</em>.

                <b>Ticky Tacky Boxes</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                All HTML elements of a webpage either Inline or Block. Block elements are all boxes. It may not seem so with so many circles, triangles, and squiggles. All of the areas set aside for the shapes to exist are boxes. This also includes the areas that contain text.

                <b>Web Browser Dev Tools</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                The <em>Dev Tools</em> in most web browsers are good ways to inspect and test changes to webpages. Testing changes on webpages is temporary. It does not save these changes to the HTML or CSS files. A simple refresh of the page from the original file is enough to reset the page back to its original state.

            </p>
            <p>
                It is important to use a text editor that is designed for software development. There are several good editors avalible. Because I use a Macintosh, I prefer some editors that may or may not be availible to other platforms. This Nanodegree from Udacity uses the <em>Sublime Text</em> editor as the default. I also have used <em>Coderunner 2</em>, and <em>Atom</em> for the Python class I have taken.

                <b>More CSS</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                As mentioned before, CSS file work in conjunction with HTML documents to style the webpage. To do this the CSS needs to be able to deferenciate between the diferent section of the page. One way of doing this is to encapsulate parts of the code in containers like <em>Div's</em>. Div tags can appear inside of other Div's, and they can be nested as far as needed.
                <br>
                In order to be able to call these Div's in the CSS, they need to have <em>Classes</em> asigned to them. A Class is a tag for the container adds that container to a group so the same styling can be added to all of the group. This allows for quicker coding than doing all of the styling indiviually.
                <br>
                There is one other tag that can be used. The <em>ID</em> tag allows someone to spicificlly identify one single container in the code. ID's are used to lable one indiviual element for special asignment in CSS. It is not recomended doing this unless needed because by calling one element out as spiecal, it adds more code, which is more time and energy.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="info" id="lesson-3-2">
            <p>
                <b>Inline Style</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Style can be added to the HTML directly by useing the style tag. By encapulating CSS code in Style tags in the HTML, a CSS file may not be needed for a small project. This is not recomended, but for small projects, this may be excepable.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="info" id="lesson-3-3">
            <p>
                <b>Checking Code</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Even though we do our best at not making mistakes in the code we write, mistakes do happen. Sometimes we are on a role, in the zone, or whatever term you would like to use, and we forget to close a tag, or forget a Div. If after finishing the section that was being worked on things do not look right, try to isolate the postion of the code that is the offending party, then work in from there.
                <br>
                Also, there is a website that can check for validation of the code. HTML can be checked here: <a href="http://validator.w3.org">validator.w3.org</a>. CSS can be checked here: <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator">jigsaw.w3.org</a>.

            <p>
                It is important to minimise repetition whenever possible. By reducing repetition we save time and effort. We also minimize mistakes by writing less code. Also, by keeping the code smaller, we inherently keep file size smaller which is always helpful economiclly, and for loading speads.
